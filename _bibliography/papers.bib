  abstract      = "Fluorescence spectra of the $8P_\{J\} \rightarrow 6P_\{J'\}$
                   ($J$ and $J'$ = 3/2, 1/2) electric quadrupole transition of
                   cesium atoms have been observed with a heated cesium vapor
                   cell. We determined the ratio of the transition
                   probabilities of $8P_\{J\}\rightarrow6P_\{J'\}$ to
                   $8P_\{J\}\rightarrow5D_\{3/2\}$ by comparing their
                   respective photon emission rates. The results are in good
                   agreement with our theoretical calculations. These
                   measurements provide crucial parameters for tests of
                   coherent amplification method and improve knowledge of
                   cesium properties which are essential to dark matter
                   detection through atomic transitions.",
